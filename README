# The Dallas Lifespan Brain Study

The Dallas Lifespan Brain Study (DLBS) is a longitudinal multi-modal neuroimaging study of the aging mind, which was initiated in 2008 (referred to as Wave 1). Participants returned for two additional waves of data collection with an approximate interval of 4-5 years between waves. The DLBS protocol encompasses various imaging modalities, including structural MRI, diffusion MRI, and functional MRI, as well as comprehensive cognitive and psychosocial assessments. Additionally, amyloid and tau PET imaging were performed as part of the study. This data set was among the pioneering long-duration longitudinal studies that investigated MRI metrics related to brain aging, PET biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease, and cognition across the entire adult lifespan (ranging from ages 20-90). Moreover, it was one of the earliest cognitive aging studies to include in vivo measurement of tauopathy using PET imaging with radiotracer AV-1451, also known as flortaucipir.

## MRI Notes

Five dummy volumes were discarded at scan time to allow for T1 stabilization. Some participants had a second MPRAGE or FLAIR acquisition due to motion artifacts in their first scan. Participants with second MPRAGE run by wave: wave 1 (752), wave 2 (4868), wave 3 (208, 503, 557, 684, 688, 772, 1093, 1245)
Participants with second FLAIR run by wave: wave 1 (754, 779, 2872, 3693), wave 2 (196, 200, 2127, 2133), wave 3 (12, 934, 988, 1767, 2872, 4315)


## Structural MRI Data (/derivatives)

For all three waves of DLBS data collection, MRI scans were processed cross-sectionally through Freesurfer ver. 5.3 with regional parcellations based on the Desikan-Killiany atlas. Extensively trained operators inspected the reconstructed white and grey matter surfaces and performed manual edits when necessary. Quality control was extensive. A second highly trained and independent group reviewed each parcellation for accuracy. A wide variety of derived Freesurfer measures, such as cortical thickness and grey matter volume, are included in the derivatives directory. The complete Freesufer-processed scan data, which are produced after running recon-all, are not included here and only extracted values are provided.


## Functional MRI Tasks

*fMRI "Scenes Task"*: This task was designed to assess how fMRI BOLD signal during the incidental encoding of images relates to performance in a subsequent recognition test. Using an incidental encoding paradigm, participants were presented with outdoor landscape scenes and had to determine whether there was water present in each scene by pressing a yes or no button. The task consisted of three runs with a random ordering of 96 outdoor scenes (32 scenes per run) presented in an event-related design. Each image was presented for 3s, and intertrial intervals (ITIs) were jittered between 4 and 14 seconds. The total scan time was 20 minutes. Responses were recorded using a fiber-optic button box held in the right hand. Visual stimuli were presented using E-prime software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), projected through the back of the scanner and viewed though a mirror attached to the head coil. Approximately twenty minutes after the encoding trial, an off-line recognition task was administered outside the scanner. A total of 192 pictures were presented, consisting of 96 previously encountered target scenes and 96 closely matched lure scenes. Participants were instructed to make one of three judgements: 1. “high confidence remember” to indicate confident recognition of the exact picture ; 2) “low confidence remember” to indicate recognition with low confidence; 3. “new item” to indicate that the picture was not previously presented. The recognition task allowed participants to respond at their own pace with a maximum response time of 4 seconds for each trial. 

*fMRI "Words Task"*: This block-design fMRI task was designed to investigate patterns of fMRI BOLD signal during semantic judgements with varying levels of difficulty and ambiguity. Participants were shown a total of 128 words, presented in blocks of “easy” (64 non-ambiguous) and “hard” (64 ambiguous) trials based on the living/nonliving classification of the words. Upon viewing each word, participants made a living or non-living semantic judgment by pressing a button with their right index for “yes” (living) or middle finger for “no” (not living). Examples of easy (non-ambiguous) words included “walrus”, “truck”, “asphalt”. Examples of hard (ambiguous) words included “speaker”, “virus”, and “sponge”. The hard words were intended to elicit increased neural processing and greater task demands. During each stimulus presentation, the semantic decision response time was recorded. Each word was displayed for 2500 ms followed by a 500 ms fixation period (crosshair). The experiment consisted of 8 blocks of easy items and 8 blocks of hard items, with 8 words per block. The easy and hard blocks were presented in a pseudo-randomized order, and the words were randomly distributed among the easy and hard condition blocks. Additionally, three 24-second fixation blocks were included as a baseline for the scan session. The total scan time was 7.7 min, including a 6-second fixation interval before the first stimulus block. Responses were recorded using a fiber-optic button box held in the right hand. Visual stimuli were presented using E-prime software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) projected through the back of the scanner and viewed through a mirror attached to the head coil. Subject-specific stimulus onset files for the words task were found to be inaccurate. Therefore, a study-wide stimulus onset asynchrony file is provided in this project’s root directory (task-Words_run-1_events.tsv). 

*fMRI "Ventral Visual Task" ("vv")*:  This task was designed to assess age-related changes in dedifferentiation, including the neural selectivity to various visual stimuli. Participants viewed images from seven categories: human faces, primate faces, domestic cat faces, wild cat faces, houses, chairs, and phase-scrambled control stimuli. Each category consisted of 64 gray-scale photographs (400 pixels wide x 300 pixels tall), except for domestic and wild cat faces, which had 32 photographs each. The images of human faces were sourced from the face library of Minear and Park (2004) and included individuals of different ages, races, and genders. All face images depicted individuals facing forward with neutral expressions. Animal photographs (primate, domestic and wild cats) were obtained from the internet and cropped to ensure clear visibility of the animal’s face. Similar to human faces, only animal images with front-facing views and neutral expressions were selected. Houses were photographed from various locations across the United States, and photographs of chairs were sourced from furniture websites. To create control stimuli, phase-scrambled images were generated by scrambling the phase information in all the experimental stimuli. This process preserved the spatial frequency information while rendering the visual content meaningless. The images were presented in 16-second blocks, with each image displayed for 2 seconds. A total of 8 blocks were presented for each category, distributed across two separate runs with four blocks per run. The order of the blocks was randomized for each participant to minimize potential order effects. The stimuli were presented using E-prime software (Psychology Software Tools) and displayed through a back-projection system. 

Note: Slice timing info for these three tasks is not currently provided.


## PET Data (/derivatives)

*PET-Amyloid Data*: The Dallas Lifespan Brain Study (DLBS), initiated in 2008, employed new in vivo imaging techniques to assess the presence of AD pathology, aiming to investigate the aging process and cognition. One such method scanned for beta-amyloid using the radioligand 18F-AV-45, also known as florbetapir. The corresponding data set includes standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) for eight key regions that were averaged to form a global SUVR value as well as PET counts for a wide range of Freesurfer regions. The eight regions included: anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, lateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, precuneus, lateral parietal, lateral occipital, and lateral temporal cortices. Whole cerebellum was used as the reference region when computing SUVRs. For further details on the processing of PET measures, please refer to the Key to the Kingdom (KTTK) file for additional processing information for PET measures.

*PET-Tau Data*: At waves 2 and 3, scanning of tau burden was conducted using the radioligand 18F-AV-1451, also known as flortaucipir. The corresponding data set includes SUVRs for a temporal meta region presented by Jack et al., 2018, which includes inferior temporal, middle temporal, entorhinal, parahippocampus, fusiform, and amygdala. This region was selected due to its sensitivity in detecting tau accumulation in otherwise healthy aging. Whole cerebellum was used as the reference region when computing SUVRs.
